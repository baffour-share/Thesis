ABSTRACT="Facial expression recognition has gained much attention in recent years in
the field of artificial intelligence. Many research works achieved
state-of-the-art results using large convolutional neural network with
millions of trainable parameters requiring high computational power. These
kinds of network models are infeasible for real-time application
particularly running on power constrained devices. In this paper, we
present a new and efficient `light weight' Convolutional Neural Network for
real-time emotion recognition. Our proposed model architecture is based on
the implementation of depth-wise separable 2D convolution which reduces the
network parameters drastically thereby accelerating the overall performance
speed making it suitable for real-time application. We evaluate our model
performance on FER-2013 dataset provided on the Kaggle facial expression
recognition competition and the Japanese Female Facial Expression (JAFFE)
database. Our model achieves very competitive results with very minimum
parameters and presents itself a better choice over state-of-the-art models
for real-time applications. Finally, we demonstrate that our model can meet
real-time needs by connecting a live video stream to a face detector to
feed images to our trained model. The model subsequently classifies facial
expressions into one of the seven emotions (Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happy,
Neutral, Sad, and Surprise).",
