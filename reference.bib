ROC graphs are commonly used in medical decision making, and in recent years have been used increasingly in machine learning and data mining research. Although ROC graphs are apparently simple, there are some common misconceptions and pitfalls when using them in practice. The purpose of this article is to serve as an introduction to ROC graphs and as a guide for using them in research."

This database is unique from three aspects: i) the facial expressions are composed of judiciously selected subset of Action Units as well as the six basic emotions, and many actors/actresses are incorporated to obtain more realistic expression data; ii) a rich set of head pose variations are available; and iii) different types of face occlusions are included. Hence, this new database can be a very valuable resource for development and evaluation of algorithms on face recognition under adverse conditions and facial expression analysis as well as for facial expression synthesis.",

abstract="We propose a semi-supervised approach to solve the task of emotion recognition in 2D face images using recent ideas in deep learning for handling the factors of variation present in data. An emotion classification algorithm should be both robust to (1) remaining variations due to the pose of the face in the image after centering and alignment, (2) the identity or morphology of the face. In order to achieve this invariance, we propose to learn a hierarchy of features in which we gradually filter the factors of variation arising from both (1) and (2). We address (1) by using a multi-scale contractive convolutional network (CCNET) in order to obtain invariance to translations of the facial traits in the image. Using the feature representation produced by the CCNET, we train a Contractive Discriminative Analysis (CDA) feature extractor, a novel variant of the Contractive Auto-Encoder (CAE), designed to learn a representation separating out the emotion-related factors from the others (which mostly capture the subject identity, and what is left of pose after the CCNET). This system beats the state-of-the-art on a recently proposed dataset for facial expression recognition, the Toronto Face Database, moving the state-of-art accuracy from 82.4{\%} to 85.0{\%}, while the CCNET and CDA improve accuracy of a standard CAE by 8{\%}.",

The ssRBM with tiled-convolution weight sharing (TssRBM) achieves or surpasses the state-of-the-art on texture synthesis and inpainting by parametric models. We also develop a novel RBM model with a spike-and-slab visible layer and binary variables in the hidden layer. This model is designed to be stacked on top of the ssRBM. We show the resulting deep belief network (DBN) is a powerful generative model that improves on single-layer models and is capable of modeling not only single high-resolution and challenging textures but also multiple textures with fixed-size filters in the bottom layer.}

abstract="The cross-entropy (CE) method is a new generic approach to combinatorial and multi-extremal optimization and rare event simulation. The purpose of this tutorial is to give a gentle introduction to the CE method. We present the CE methodology, the basic algorithm and its modifications, and discuss applications in combinatorial optimization and machine learning.",

abstract = "Small signals may contain important information. Mass spectra of chemical compounds are usually given in a format of sparse high-dimensional data of large dynamic range. As peaks at high m/z (mass to charge ratio) region of a mass spectrum contribute to sensory information, they should not be ignored during the dimensionality reduction process even if the peak is small. However, in most of dimensionality reduction techniques, large peaks in a dataset are typically more emphasized than tiny peaks when Euclidean space is assessed. Autoencoders are widely used nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique, which is known as one special form of artificial neural networks to gain a compressed, distributed representation after learning. In this paper, we present an autoencoder which uses IS (Itakura-Saito) distance as its cost function to achieve a high capability of approximation of small target inputs in dimensionality reduction. The result of comparative experiments showed that our new autoencoder achieved the higher performance in approximation of small targets than that of the autoencoders with conventional cost functions such as the mean squared error and the cross-entropy."
